# @poncho-ai/sdk

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- [#10](https://github.com/cesr/poncho-ai/pull/10) [`d5bce7b`](https://github.com/cesr/poncho-ai/commit/d5bce7be5890c657bea915eb0926feb6de66b218) Thanks [@cesr](https://github.com/cesr)! - Add generic messaging layer with Slack as the first adapter. Agents can now respond to @mentions in Slack by adding `messaging: [{ platform: 'slack' }]` to `poncho.config.js`. Includes signature verification, threaded conversations, processing indicators, and Vercel `waitUntil` support.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [`035e8b3`](https://github.com/cesr/poncho-ai/commit/035e8b300ac4de6e7cbc4e2ab6bd06cdfd0e1ae3) Thanks [@cesr](https://github.com/cesr)! - Add multimodal file support for agents — images, PDFs, and text files can be uploaded via the web UI, HTTP API, and terminal CLI. Includes pluggable upload storage (local, Vercel Blob, S3), write-behind caching, build-time dependency injection, and graceful handling of unsupported formats.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [`a1df23f`](https://github.com/cesr/poncho-ai/commit/a1df23f339d815c30948ebcd275209366a3d2a72) Thanks [@cesr](https://github.com/cesr)! - Add cooperative run cancellation: stop active runs via Ctrl+C (CLI), stop button (Web UI), or the /stop API endpoint. Partial output is preserved and empty assistant messages are skipped to prevent conversation corruption.

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Improve deployment scaffolding and init onboarding for production targets.

  The CLI now scaffolds deployment files directly in project roots (including Vercel `api/index.mjs` + `vercel.json`), adds safer overwrite behavior with `--force`, and normalizes runtime dependencies for deployable projects. Onboarding now captures `deploy.target` so new projects can scaffold the selected platform during `poncho init`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial release of Poncho - an open framework for building and deploying AI agents.
  - `@poncho-ai/sdk`: Core types and utilities for building Poncho skills
  - `@poncho-ai/harness`: Agent execution runtime with conversation loop, tool dispatch, and streaming
  - `@poncho-ai/client`: TypeScript client for calling deployed Poncho agents
  - `@poncho-ai/cli`: CLI for building and deploying AI agents
