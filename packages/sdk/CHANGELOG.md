# @poncho-ai/sdk

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- Improve deployment scaffolding and init onboarding for production targets.

  The CLI now scaffolds deployment files directly in project roots (including Vercel `api/index.mjs` + `vercel.json`), adds safer overwrite behavior with `--force`, and normalizes runtime dependencies for deployable projects. Onboarding now captures `deploy.target` so new projects can scaffold the selected platform during `poncho init`.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial release of Poncho - an open framework for building and deploying AI agents.
  - `@poncho-ai/sdk`: Core types and utilities for building Poncho skills
  - `@poncho-ai/harness`: Agent execution runtime with conversation loop, tool dispatch, and streaming
  - `@poncho-ai/client`: TypeScript client for calling deployed Poncho agents
  - `@poncho-ai/cli`: CLI for building and deploying AI agents
