# @poncho-ai/cli

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- BREAKING: Switch to AgentSkills allowed-tools format with mcp/ prefix

  Replace nested `tools: { mcp: [...], scripts: [...] }` with flat `allowed-tools: [...]` list format. MCP tools now require `mcp/` prefix (e.g., `mcp/github/list_issues`).

  Migration: Update AGENT.md and SKILL.md frontmatter from:

  ```yaml
  tools:
    mcp:
      - github/list_issues
  ```

  To:

  ```yaml
  allowed-tools:
    - mcp/github/list_issues
  ```

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix environment detection in production deployments

  Agents deployed to Vercel, Railway, Render, AWS Lambda, and Fly.io now correctly detect their environment automatically without requiring manual NODE_ENV configuration. The resolved environment is now properly passed to the AgentHarness constructor.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Split agent template and development context

  Move development-specific guidance from AGENT.md template into runtime-injected development context. Production agents now receive a cleaner prompt focused on task execution, while development agents get additional context about customization and setup.
