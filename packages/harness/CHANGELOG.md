# @poncho-ai/harness

## 0.11.2

### Patch Changes

- [`3dcb914`](https://github.com/cesr/poncho-ai/commit/3dcb914acd22c403ff5372d94a0fc2152a2574b3) Thanks [@cesr](https://github.com/cesr)! - Fix scaffolded dependency versions during `poncho init` so npm installs no longer request unavailable `^0.1.0` packages.

  Improve runtime resilience by retrying transient provider/model failures, returning clearer provider error codes, and sanitizing malformed conversation history so interrupted/bad-state chats can continue.

## 0.11.1

### Patch Changes

- [`8a3937e`](https://github.com/cesr/poncho-ai/commit/8a3937e95bfb7f269e8fe46dd41640eacb30af43) Thanks [@cesr](https://github.com/cesr)! - Increase the first model response timeout from 30s to 180s to reduce premature model timeout errors on slower providers.

## 0.11.0

### Minor Changes

- [`a1df23f`](https://github.com/cesr/poncho-ai/commit/a1df23f339d815c30948ebcd275209366a3d2a72) Thanks [@cesr](https://github.com/cesr)! - Add cooperative run cancellation: stop active runs via Ctrl+C (CLI), stop button (Web UI), or the /stop API endpoint. Partial output is preserved and empty assistant messages are skipped to prevent conversation corruption.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [[`a1df23f`](https://github.com/cesr/poncho-ai/commit/a1df23f339d815c30948ebcd275209366a3d2a72)]:
  - @poncho-ai/sdk@0.6.0

## 0.10.3

### Patch Changes

- Reduce serverless warnings when loading TypeScript skill scripts.

  The harness now uses `jiti` first for `.ts/.mts/.cts` scripts in `run_skill_script`, avoiding Node's native ESM warning spam for TypeScript files in deployed environments.

## 0.10.2

### Patch Changes

- Improve runtime loading of `poncho.config.js` in serverless environments.

  The harness now falls back to `jiti` when native ESM import of `poncho.config.js` fails, allowing deploys where bundlers/runtime packaging treat project `.js` files as CommonJS. The CLI patch picks up the updated harness runtime.

## 0.10.1

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies []:
  - @poncho-ai/sdk@0.5.0

## 0.7.1

### Patch Changes

- Persist pending approvals on conversation state and add SSE reconnect endpoint so Web UI approvals survive page refresh and stream responses in real-time.

## 0.7.0

### Minor Changes

- Simplify MCP tool patterns and improve auth UI
  - Allow tool patterns without server prefix in poncho.config.js (e.g., `include: ['*']` instead of `include: ['linear/*']`)
  - Fix auth screen button styling to be fully rounded with centered arrow
  - Add self-extension capabilities section to development mode instructions
  - Update documentation to clarify MCP pattern formats

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- Add markdown table support and fix Latitude telemetry integration
  - Add markdown table rendering with `marked` library in web UI
  - Add table styling with horizontal scroll and hover effects
  - Add margins to HR elements for better spacing
  - Integrate Latitude telemetry with Vercel AI SDK using event queue pattern
  - Enable real-time streaming while capturing complete traces
  - Fix telemetry to show all messages and interactions in Latitude dashboard

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- d6256b2: Migrate to Vercel AI SDK for unified model provider support

  This major refactoring replaces separate OpenAI and Anthropic client implementations with Vercel AI SDK's unified interface, simplifying the codebase by ~1,265 lines and enabling easier addition of new model providers.

  **Key improvements:**
  - Unified model provider interface via Vercel AI SDK
  - JSON Schema to Zod converter for tool definitions
  - Fixed tool call preservation in multi-step agent loops
  - Simplified architecture with better maintainability
  - Added comprehensive error handling for step execution

  **Breaking changes (internal API only):**
  - `ModelClient` interface removed (use Vercel AI SDK directly)
  - `OpenAiModelClient` and `AnthropicModelClient` classes removed
  - `createModelClient()` replaced with `createModelProvider()`

  **User-facing API unchanged:**
  - AGENT.md format unchanged
  - Tool definitions unchanged (JSON Schema still works)
  - Model provider names unchanged (`openai`, `anthropic`)
  - Agent behavior unchanged from user perspective

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Fix MCP tool prefix to use `mcp:` instead of `@mcp:` for YAML compatibility. The `@` character is reserved in YAML and cannot start plain values without quoting.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- BREAKING: Switch to AgentSkills allowed-tools format with mcp/ prefix

  Replace nested `tools: { mcp: [...], scripts: [...] }` with flat `allowed-tools: [...]` list format. MCP tools now require `mcp/` prefix (e.g., `mcp/github/list_issues`).

  Migration: Update AGENT.md and SKILL.md frontmatter from:

  ```yaml
  tools:
    mcp:
      - github/list_issues
  ```

  To:

  ```yaml
  allowed-tools:
    - mcp/github/list_issues
  ```

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Split agent template and development context

  Move development-specific guidance from AGENT.md template into runtime-injected development context. Production agents now receive a cleaner prompt focused on task execution, while development agents get additional context about customization and setup.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Implement tool policy and declarative intent system

  Add comprehensive tool policy framework for MCP and script tools with pattern matching, environment-based configuration, and declarative tool intent in AGENT.md and SKILL.md frontmatter.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Initial release of Poncho - an open framework for building and deploying AI agents.
  - `@poncho-ai/sdk`: Core types and utilities for building Poncho skills
  - `@poncho-ai/harness`: Agent execution runtime with conversation loop, tool dispatch, and streaming
  - `@poncho-ai/client`: TypeScript client for calling deployed Poncho agents
  - `@poncho-ai/cli`: CLI for building and deploying AI agents

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies []:
  - @poncho-ai/sdk@0.2.0
